'''Liability disclaimer'''

In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder, or any other party who modifies and/or conveys this application as permitted by the specified license(s), be liable to you for any damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use this application (including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of this application to operate with any other programs), even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages. There is no warranty for this application, to the extend permitted by applicable law. Except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and/or other parties provide this application "as is" without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of liability for merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of this application is with you. Should this application prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction. If the liability disclaimer provided cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with this application, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of this application in return for a fee. If there are differences between this liability disclaimer and a liability disclaimer provided by any license(s) under whose terms the use of this application is permitted, this version shall apply. If there are differences or obscurities between this liability disclaimer and any version of it translated for convenience, this english version shall apply.
